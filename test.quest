		santa: "I deperately need some help around here."
		santa: "You really can't get the staff these days!"
		you:  "No problem Santa, how can I help?"
		santa: "First things first, Lewis could use some help with the choir."
		santa: "I think you're going to love what they have come up with this year."
		santa: "You can find lewis and the choir in the Studio."
		santa: "But there are also many Elves all around the Grotto, in need of help."
		santa: "If you are so inclined..."
		santa: "You could think of the Elves like side quests, Ho ho ho!"
		you: "Sounds good Santa, I'll get right on it!"
		santa: "I'm counting on you Mittens, Christmas may be saved yet!"
